    </div>

    <div class="jokes">
        <p>🎣 **Living by the seat of your pants is over.** Charlotte has a **color-coded calendar** and you have **weekly sync meetings** about “household operations.”</p>

        <p>💰 **Your fishing boat is no longer your biggest expense.** That title now belongs to **HomeGoods, wedding gifts, and an unexplained candle budget.**</p>

        <p>⌛ **Last-minute plans?** Cute. **Now you RSVP within 24 hours—or she does it for you.**</p>

        <p>👔 **Your wardrobe is no longer just your business.** You’ll leave the house **wearing what Charlotte approves** or **hearing about it all night.**</p>

        <p>🔨 **House projects have deadlines now.** And **“I’ll get to it” has an expiration date.** (Hint: It’s much sooner than you think.)</p>

        <p>🎒 **You are no longer in charge of your own packing.** Charlotte knows **exactly** what you forgot before you even do.</p>

        <p>🐶 **You and Riley used to be a team.** Now he’s **more loyal to Charlotte**—especially when she’s handing out treats **and you’re getting “the look.”**</p>

        <p>🚤 **Boats have rules, marriage has more.** And **none of them come with a manual.**</p>
